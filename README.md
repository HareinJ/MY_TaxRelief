# Excel LHDN Calculator Form

## Purpose
The purpose of this Excel Form is to calculate the total tax payable by an individual to Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia (LHDNM) for the Year of Assessment 2020. Joint Assessment is not included in this Excel Form.

## Features of the Excel LHDN Calculator Form
There are 5 worksheets in the Excel Workbook which are:
1. Compute Income Tax (Part B)

The Excel LHDN Calculator Form only requires input of amounts (in RM) in first three worksheets. Once the individual has input all the amounts, the Excel LHDN Calculator Form would automatically calculate the total tax payable. 

For more detailed information on how to fill in the Excel LHDN Calculator Form, the individual can refer to the User Manual and the Example Case side by side.

## Advantages of Using the Excel LHDN Calculator Form
The Excel LHDN Calculator Form to calculate payable income tax is almost similar to Form BE. The similarities would help the individual when filling up Form BE. The individual would need to type in the numbers in the required sections (highlighted in Orange) and the Excel Form would automatically calculate the income tax payable.
